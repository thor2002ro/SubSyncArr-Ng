# 🧬 SubSyncArr-Ng

**SubSyncArr-Ng** (Next-Generation) is an automated subtitle synchronization suite designed to run seamlessly in Docker. It continuously monitors your movie and TV show libraries, identifies out-of-sync subtitles, and synchronizes them with precision using three complementary synchronization engines: **ffsubsync**, **autosubsync**, and **alass**.

SubSyncArr-Ng is non-destructive: it preserves your original subtitles untouched and creates distinct synchronized copies for each engine, providing full redundancy and flexibility in players like Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, and Kodi.

## 🌟 What's New in SubSyncArr-Ng

- 🌙 **Modern Dark Mode**: Sleek dark interface with responsive theme toggle (☀️ / 🌙), `localStorage` persistence, and automatic operating system theme detection (`prefers-color-scheme`).
- ⚡ **Live Real-Time File Logs**: Streaming terminal console embedded directly inside the "Currently Processing" card with an active status pulse and auto-scroll, showing audio extraction, speech feature detection, and alignment progress in real time.
- 📄 **Detailed File Log Modal**: Inspect complete stdout, stderr, execution duration, and timeline for any file (both currently running and completed/historical) with one click.
- 🗑️ **Orphaned Subtitle Cleanup (`DELETE_ORPHANED_SRT=true`)**: Automatically purges orphaned subtitle files and their previously synced variants if no corresponding video file exists on disk.
- 🎯 **Smart TV Episode Number Matching**: Intelligently resolves episode numbering differences between subtitles and videos (e.g., matching `00x20` to `S00E20`), preventing valid TV subtitles from being misidentified as orphans.
- 🛠️ **MKV Attachment Streams Fix for `alass`**: Includes an integrated `ffprobe` wrapper that handles MKV files containing embedded attachment streams (such as subtitle fonts or cover art) without crashing Rust's JSON deserializer.
- ⚡ **Continuous Worker Pool**: Dynamic queue-based concurrency replaces rigid batching—as soon as any worker completes a file, it immediately pulls the next file from the queue, maximizing CPU utilization.
- 🧬 **Dual-Fingerprint Anti-Loop (Video + SRT)**: Prevents endless re-processing loops when external tools (Bazarr, Plex, promotion scripts) rename or move synced subtitles. Computes a fast header/tail SHA-256 for the video and full SHA-256 for the subtitle. If Bazarr downloads an updated/better subtitle, SubSyncArr-Ng automatically detects the change and resyncs!
- ↻ **Interactive Circuit Breaker Reset**: Direct `[↻ Reset]` button right inside the Web UI file cards to unblock files blacklisted by the 3-failure circuit breaker with a single click.
- 📁 **Extended Video Formats**: Native support for `.mkv`, `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.ts`, `.m4v`, `.webm`, `.wmv`, and `.flv`.

## ⚙️ Why 3 Different Sync Engines? How Do They Work?

No single subtitle synchronization algorithm works perfectly for every scenario (movies, TV shows, PAL/NTSC frame rate changes, commercial breaks, noisy audio, or sparse forced dialogue). For this reason, SubSyncArr-Ng runs **three complementary engines**:

```
                  ┌─────────────────┐
                  │ Input Subtitle  │ (.srt)
                  └────────┬────────┘
                           │
       ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│  ffsubsync   │    │ autosubsync  │    │    alass     │
└──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘    └──────┬───────┘
       │                   │                   │
       ▼                   ▼                   ▼
.ffsubsync.srt      .autosubsync.srt       .alass.srt
```

### 1. `ffsubsync` (Fast Forward Subtitle Sync)
- **Technology**: Python + WebRTC Voice Activity Detection (VAD) + Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
- **How it works**: Uses ffmpeg to extract the audio stream and translates both the audio voice activity and the subtitle timestamps into mathematical signals. It applies FFT-accelerated cross-correlation to find the optimal global linear offset and speed skew.
- **Best for**: Standard movie releases, linear delays (e.g. subtitles starting 5 seconds too late), and frame-rate conversions (e.g. 23.976 fps to 25.000 fps).
- **Speed**: Extremely fast (typically 5–15 seconds).
- **Output**: `<filename>.<lang>.ffsubsync.srt`

### 2. `autosubsync` (Acoustic Feature & Speech Detection)
- **Technology**: Python + NumPy/SciPy + Pretrained Neural Acoustic Model.
- **How it works**: Computes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and energy spectrograms from the audio track. A trained machine learning model identifies speech frames and computes correlation curves against dialogue blocks across a spectrum of candidate skew factors.
- **Best for**: Clean movie dialogue and studio audio tracks where speech cadence can be reliably matched.
- **Special Handling in Ng**: Because autosubsync requires continuous dialogue, SubSyncArr-Ng automatically skips `.forced.srt` files for autosubsync (delegating them to `ffsubsync` and `alass`) and limits worker threads to 1 (`--parallelism 1`) to ensure 4K Remuxes do not trigger Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors.
- **Output**: `<filename>.<lang>.autosubsync.srt`

### 3. `alass` (Automatic Language-Agnostic Subtitle Synchronization)
- **Technology**: Rust + Dynamic Programming Alignment.
- **How it works**: Analyzes pauses and voice segments using advanced dynamic programming. Unlike pure linear-shift tools, `alass` can split subtitles into independent segments and align each chunk separately.
- **Best for**: TV shows with commercial breaks, Director's Cut vs Theatrical releases, or video files where scenes have been added or removed in the middle of the timeline.
- **Speed**: Blazing fast native Rust execution (typically 3–10 seconds).
- **Output**: `<filename>.<lang>.alass.srt`

## 🔄 What Happens During a Scan? (The Workflow)

1. **Discovery & Filtering**: SubSyncArr-Ng scans all paths configured in `SCAN_PATHS` for `.srt` files. Files that are already synchronized (or whose synced outputs already exist) are skipped to save system resources.
2. **Video Association**: The engine pairs each `.srt` file with its video file in the same directory:
   - First by exact name match.
   - Then by progressive tag stripping (removing release group, audio, and resolution tags).
   - Finally by TV episode pattern matching (`00x20` matches `S00E20`).
3. **Orphan Cleanup**: If a subtitle has no corresponding video file in its directory and `DELETE_ORPHANED_SRT` is enabled, the orphan subtitle and any obsolete synced variants are deleted automatically.
4. **Multi-Engine Execution**: Each enabled engine runs in sequence:
   - Real-time stdout and stderr output is streamed live to the Web UI via WebSockets.
   - Each engine produces its own separate `.srt` output.
   - If one engine fails or has insufficient fit quality on noisy background audio, the others continue and succeed.
5. **Database & History**: Results, timestamps, and full execution logs are recorded in the local SQLite database.
